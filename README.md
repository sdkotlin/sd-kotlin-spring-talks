# San Diego Kotlin User Group Spring Talks

Code examples from
[San Diego Kotlin User Group](https://www.meetup.com/sd-kotlin/) meetings on
using [Spring](https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework) and
[Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) with the
[Kotlin](http://kotlinlang.org/) programming language.

## Building

The project is built
with [Gradle](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/userguide.html) and uses
the [Gradle Wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html#gradle_wrapper_reference),
which can be invoked from the project root once
the [Gradle prerequisites](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/installation.html#sec:prerequisites)
are met.

The project currently requires Gradle to be invoked with a Java Development
Kit (JDK) version 21 or higher.

The primary build task is `build`.
